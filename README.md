Modular Dynamic Artificial Intelligence Network

Inspired by the Replicators from Stargate SG1 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(Stargate)), we are setting out to create a new kind of neural network. We believe that a modular approach to Artificial Intelligence can be more effective than a single large neural network. This project aims to create a library capable of using a growing set of plugins capable of machine learning and specialized services. These services will be capable of reconfiguring themselves to adapt to any application.
